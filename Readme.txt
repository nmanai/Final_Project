This repository contains data, a piece of code, a txt file containing the output from our script, and this Readme file.

The python script is used to obtain statistical information such as: the number of unique haplotypes / the number of
segregation sites and their positions from a dataset in fasta format. In it, we create multiple functions to facilitate our calculations and information extraction.
- It is worth noting that this code was written specifically for the data set I used it on (bp_seq.fasta).  However, it can be altered to work on any fasta file.


The data is stored in "bp_seq.fasta", which contains 134 DNA sequences stored in a fasta format.  The genetic sequences are those of green sea turtles.
